   There are seven different text editors on the workstation.

3. In order to delete a file I would either drag the file into the trash or go into the file manager and right click on the file and select "delete."

4. Three web broswers are available. Chromium Web Browser, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. 
Firefox does not support java or flash. Chrome and Chromium support flash. In order to determine flash/java support, I googled whether the browsers supported flash or java.

5. Could use GIMP Image Editor or Inkscape to edit an image.

6. To make the file system tree, first type "pwd" and then enter to make sure you are in the home directory. Then type "mkdir CPSC 1011" (or I typed CPSC_1011) and press enter the make the first folder in the tree. The type "cd CPSC 1011" and enter to move into that directory where you can create a new directory by typing "mk lab01." Then type "cd lab01" and enter that directory, where you can make the final directory in the filesystem tree by typing "mkdir inlab."
